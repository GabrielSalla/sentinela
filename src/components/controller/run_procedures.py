"""Procedures are a way to run some checks periodically to make sure everything is working as
expected.
An example of a procedure is to check if there are any monitors that are stuck in the 'processing'
state for too long. It can happen if the monitor execution is abruptly interrupted, and the
execution doesn't complete properly. If this happens, the monitor won't be processed again."""
