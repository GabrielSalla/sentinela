# Slack Plugin
The Slack plugin offers an interface to interact with Sentinela through Slack. It allows users to receive notifications from Sentinela in a Slack channel while also providing useful commands from notification buttons or Slack messages mentioning the Sentinela bot.

## Enabling
To enable the Slack plugin, add `slack` to the `plugins` list in the configuration file.

## Create the Slack app
First create a Slack app in your workspace. The provided app manifest [template](../resources/slack_app_manifest.yaml) has the basic configuration and permissions needed for the Sentinela Slack app.

## Environment variables
The following environment variables are used by the Slack plugin:
- `SLACK_TOKEN`: The token used to send messages to Slack. This token is generated when you create your Slack app and install it in your workspace. Example: `xoxb-1234567890-1234567890123-12345678901234567890abcdef`.
- `SLACK_WEBSOCKET_ENABLED`: A flag to enable or disable the websocket connection for receiving events from Slack. Set this to `true` to enable the websocket or `false` to disable it. Defaults to `false`.
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`: The token used to start the websocket connection for receiving events from interactions with the Sentinela Slack app. This token is generated when you create your Slack app and enable the Socket Mode. Example: `xapp-1234567890-1234567890123-12345678901234567890abcdef`.
- `SAMPLE_SLACK_CHANNEL`: The Slack channel where notifications for **sample monitors** will be sent. Example: `C0011223344`.
- `SAMPLE_SLACK_MENTION`: The Slack user or group to mention in notifications for **sample monitors**. Example: `U0011223344`.
- `SLACK_MAIN_CHANNEL`: The Slack channel where notifications for **internal monitors** will be sent. Example: `C0011223344`.
- `SLACK_MAIN_MENTION`: The Slack user or group to mention in notifications for **internal monitors**. Example: `U0011223344`.

## Slack commands
Sentinela provides two main ways to interact through Slack:
1. **Buttons** in notifications sent to a Slack channel.
2. **Messages** mentioning the Sentinela Slack app directly.

### Buttons in notifications
Slack notifications can include buttons to interact with the notifications, depending on it's priority and status. Buttons are shown only for active notifications.

Possible buttons:
- **Ack**: Acknowledge the alert. Visible if the alert has not yet been acknowledged at the priority level.
- **Lock**: Lock the alert. Visible if the alert is not already locked.
- **Solve**: Solves the alert. Visible only if the monitorâ€™s issue settings is set as **not solvable**.

### Messages mentioning Sentinela
As a Slack app, Sentinela can also respond to direct commands sent in a message. To interact this way, mention the Sentinela app, followed by the desired action.

Available commands:
- `disable monitor {monitor_name}`: Disable the specified monitor.
- `enable monitor {monitor_name}`: Enable the specified monitor.
- `ack {alert_id}`: Acknowledge the specified alert.
- `lock {alert_id}`: Lock the specified alert.
- `solve {alert_id}`: Solve the specified alert.
- `drop issue {issue_id}`: Drop the specified issue.
- `resend notifications`: Delete and resend all active notifications for the current channel. Sometimes a Slack channel can have a lot of messages and a notification might get lost in the past. This command will resend the notification message so it'll be among the latest messages.

Examples:
- `@Sentinela disable monitor some_monitor`
- `@Sentinela enable monitor some_monitor`
- `@Sentinela ack 1234`
- `@Sentinela lock 2345`
- `@Sentinela solve 3456`
- `@Sentinela drop issue 1212`
- `@Sentinela resend notifications`

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure the message is using the correct `@` mention for the Sentinela Slack app in your workspace.

## Actions
Slack plugin implements a single action to handle the `resend notification` command.

## Notifications
```python
from plugins.slack.notifications import SlackNotification
```

The **SlackNotification** class manages sending notifications for alerts to a specified Slack channel.

Parameters:
- `channel`: The Slack channel where notifications will be sent.
- `title`: A title for the notification to help users to identify the problem.
- `issues_fields`: A list of fields from the issue data to include in the notification.
- `min_priority_to_send`: Minimum alert priority that triggers a notification. Notifications will be sent if the alert is not acknowledged at the current priority level and it's is greater than or equal to this setting. Defaults to `low` (P4).
- `mention`: Slack user or group to mention if the alert reaches a specified priority. Provide the Slack identifier for a user (e.g., `U0011223344`) or a group (e.g., `G0011223344`). Set to `None` to avoid mentioning anyone. Defaults to `None`.
- `min_priority_to_mention`: Minimum alert priority that triggers a mention. Mentions will occur if the alert is not acknowledged at the current priority level and it's is greater than or equal to this setting. Defaults to `moderate` (P3).
- `mention_on_update`: If set to 'False', the mention will be sent when the alert becomes unacknowledged and the priority is greater than or equal to the minimum priority to mention. If the alert is updated and the alert continues to be unacknowledged, the mention will persist. When set to 'True', the mention will be deleted and sent again every time alert is updated, if the alert is not acknowledged and the priority is greater than or equal to the minimum priority to mention. This option can be used as a renotification. Defaults to `False`.
- `issue_show_limit`: Maximum number of issues to show in the notification. If the limit is reached, the message `XXX more...` will be shown at the and of the issues list, where `XXX` is the number of issues not being shown. Defaults to 10.

The Slack message will show the alert and its issues information. The notification will persist and will be updated until the alert is detected as solved, even if its priority falls to P5.

The notification also includes buttons to interact with the alert, allowing it to be acknowledged, locked or marked as solved. The last is only included if the issues setting was set as **not solvable**.

```python
notification_options = [
    SlackNotification(
        channel="C0011223344",
        title="Alert name",
        issues_fields=["id", "name"],
        mention="U0011223344",
    )
]
```

## Services
The Slack plugin includes a service that connects to the Slack websocket API to receive mentions and button press events. Any event received will queue an action to be processed by Sentinela.
